<h2>About Us</h2>
<br>

<p>
    Welcome to <strong>Hotel Reviewer</strong> — a simple review platform created by <b>Saw</b> and <b>Lewis</b> who wanted
    to make hotel searching faster and more straightforward.
</p>

<p>
    While working on the project, we noticed that many hotel review websites were filled with long comment sections,
    ads, and complicated rating systems. We thought of a cleaner easy-to-understand website for users to quickly or submit their reviews.
</p>

<p>
    That’s why we built <strong>Hotel Reviewer</strong>. Our site uses a simple <b>1–5 number rating system</b>,
    making it easier to compare hotels in an instant.
</p>


<p>
    Thank you for checking out our website! If you have feedback or suggestions, <strong>you can send your ideas over to us at: sawzaylattnaingit@gmail.com</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Our future plans for the website include adding features like <br>
    <strong>- User photo uploads of hotels</strong><br>
    <strong>- Hotel pricing</strong><br>
    <strong>- Hotel deals for users to get rewarded for their reviews</strong><br>
    ...and many more!
